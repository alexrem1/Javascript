// a class is a blueprint for an object (it describes how one should be made)
// eg car blueprint has properties like its colour, model and functionality like ability to drive and reverse
// we can specify the value of the properties, eg a new white/yellow/green car, with the same functionality

// same principle for JS, class describes the type of object eg what properties and methods an object should have
// userClass = {username, email, login(), logout()}
// every user created with the "userClass" would have these properties and these methods but it can still be unique eg specification
// eg new userClass("ken", "ken@ken.com")
// eg new userClass("donkey", "donkey@donk.com")
