// make HTTP requests to get data from another server - we make these requests to API endpoints

// So for example imagine we had a song library at API like Spotify or soundcloud it might have an endpoint which looks something like this "http://www.musicapi.com/artist/moby". So making a request to this end point would return us a list of mobi songs.

// So from our Code which runs in the browser we would make a request to a server endpoint.Now that server would look at this request and say OK you want this data so I'll send it back to you as a response and then we'd get that data in our code and we can do something with it like render it to the browser if we want it.

// once we make a request to an endpoint from the browser we typically get back a selection of data in a format called Json and Json is a format which looks very much like JavaScript objects and then we can do something with that data.
