// Objects : properties and methods
// eg const name = ["shaun", "alex"]
// This contains an object array with a property length along with several methods

// use contructor to create a wrapper object. It will contain a primitive value that has all the different properties and methods
// eg const nameTwo = new String('Ryu');
